# Test Data

Test data for measuring CADR is available from three trials in the data/ folder. Data was collected with both the SDS011 and Sensirion SPS30 sensors and is available for both. The SPS30 data also contains temperature and humidity data, which was collected using a pimoroni enviro+. Enviro+ was distanced from pi using a gpio cable to prevent CPU heat from affecting temperature and humidity measurements.
